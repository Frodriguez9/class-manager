            This is a backend API that will slowly undergo a metamorphosis until
            it becomes a fully functional
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>.
            using the <b>Vue.js</b> framework.
            <br><br>

            The goal is to allows curious minds and talented people - who are
            willing to teach their skills using a webcam, to come together.
            The core idea is that instructors create classes and students enroll
            in them, allowing instructors to manage their online classes from
            here. That is: student registration, payments, and
            meeting-link-sharing automation.
            <br><br>

            <b>Short term TODOS:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Integrate Zoom and other 3er parties APIs</li>
              <li>Add CSS styling to home page</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            Until then, have a taste of how this <b>Class-Manager RESTful API</b>
            is working.

            <br><br>

            We will provide instructions for you to setup a
            <a href="https://www.postman.com/"><i>Postman Account</i></a>, which
            will make it easier to test all endpoints.
           </p>

           <h2>Before Starting ðŸ¤š</h2>
           <p>
             Some endpoints require especial permissions. We have created 2
             users with those permissions so that you can access and test
             those endpoints.
             <br><br>

             How to login and use our <b><i>Class-Manager API</i></b> is
             described below in the <b>API section</b>. For now, know that you
             need to log in with these users to access certain endpoints.
             <br><br>
           </p>

           <h3>Pre-registered Users</h3>

           <h3>Setup a Postman Account</h3>
           <p>
             curl requests are a little bit of a pain in the butt. An
             extra-space, using the wrong set of quotations ("",''), or even
             a copy/paste template that happens to not be plain text in the
             background, and your request will fail. So, to avoid an undesirable
             experience, take a few minutes to set up a
             <a href="https://www.postman.com/"><i>Postman Account</i></a>.
             <br><br>

             Once your account is set up, continue reading. We will let you know
             how to use Postman to unleash the power of the Class-Manager API ðŸ’ª
